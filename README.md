Zero-Interaction Security Codebase
==================================

This repository contains the codebase for the Zero-Interaction Security research project published in "Perils of Zero-Interaction Security in the Internet of Things", by Mikhail Fomichev, Max Maass, Lars Almon, Alejandro Molina, Matthias Hollick, in Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, vol. 3, Issue 1, 2019

The code in this repository is structured in several folders:

- **Preprocessing** contains scripts used to process the raw data before it is used in the different schemes. This includes features such as outlier removal or pseudonymization.
- **Schemes** contains the implementations of the different zero-interaction security schemes
- **TODO** Keep writing this once the structure becomes clearer
