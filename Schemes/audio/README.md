# Implementation of audio features

This folder contains implementation of audio features for the paper "Perils of Zero-Interaction Security in the Internet of Things", by Mikhail Fomichev, Max Maass, Lars Almon, Alejandro Molina, Matthias Hollick, in Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, vol. 3, Issue 1, 2019. 

The following audio features from the four zero-interaction schemes are implemented:

* *Audio fingerprint (AFP)* [1]
* *Time-frequency distance (TFD)* [2]
* *Noise fingerprint (NFP)* [3]
* *SoundProof (SPF)*  [4]

## Getting Started

To compute audio features, the following functions are used (brief description is provided, see comments inside *.m* files for details):

~~* *plot_error_rates.py* - a script to generate false reject rates (FRRs) with target false accept rates (FARs) plots.~~

The [results of audio feature computations](https://www.seemoo.tu-darmstadt.de/) were generated under *CentOS Linux release 7.5.1804 (kernel 3.10.0-862.9.1.el7.x86_64)* using *MATLAB R2017a (9.2.0.556344) 64-bit (glnxa64)* with the following requirements:

```
Signal Processing Toolbox (Version 7.4)
Parallel Computing Toolbox (Version 6.10)
```
**Note:** These toolboxes are not part of standard MATLAB distribution and need to be acquired separately. In a standard setup, each instance of MATLAB (i.e., launching *audioJob.m*) requires a license!


The script is used as follows:

```bash
$ mcc -R -nodisplay -T link:exe -v -m audioJob.m -a Add-Ons/Functions/DataHash/code/ -a Add-Ons/Collections/Natural-Order/Filename/Sort/code/

$ sudo ./run_audioJob.sh .../matlab/ .../CarExp/Sensor-01/audio/01.flac .../CarExp/Sensor-02/audio/02.flac .../CarExp .../tmp-for-matlab-parallel-toolbox .../local-storage

```

Here, ~/json is the folder contaning [JSON files with error rates](https://www.seemoo.tu-darmstadt.de/), and ~/gfx is the folder to store the generated plots.
